# ML Mastermind: Python AI with OpenAI API

This project integrates Python's programming capabilities with the OpenAI API to explore advanced machine learning techniques. It features real-time data analysis, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. The goal is to create a tool or application that showcases the practical applications of AI in a specific domain, such as healthcare, finance, or education. The project also has a collaborative aspect, where other developers can contribute and expand the project's capabilities.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several Python files, each responsible for a specific functionality:

- `main.py`: This is the main driver script that initializes and uses all the other modules.
- `openai_api.py`: This module is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- `data_analysis.py`: This module is used for analyzing the data obtained from the OpenAI API.
- `nlp.py`: This module processes the analyzed data using Natural Language Processing techniques.
- `predictive_model.py`: This module uses the processed data to make predictions.
- `application.py`: This module uses the predictions in a practical application.
- `collaboration.py`: This module allows for collaboration by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository and pushing the local changes to the remote repository.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

4. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Collaboration

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes in your branch.
4. Submit a pull request.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate and follow the coding style conventions.
